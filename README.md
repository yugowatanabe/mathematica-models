Collection of Mathematica files modeling and animating different macroscopic and quantum systems.

DESCRIPTION OF ANIMATIONS:
- mod1.nb models and animates
     - An oscillating pendulum where the rope is a spring.
     - An oscillating pendulum where the rope wraps around a cylinder.
     - A binary system orbiting each other.
- mod2.nb models and animates
     - Two masses of different mass connected by a spring.
     - A double pendulum.
- mod3.nb models and animates
     - A cylinder rolling down a ramp which is not fixed.
- mod4.nb illustrates
     - The wavefunction of a particle in a 3D box with different quantum states.
- mod5.nb models and animates
     - Quantum tunneling for a free particle encountering a square potential.
- mod6.nb models and animates
     - A cylinder rolling down a fixed plane but with a mass hanging by a rope from its center.
     - A pulley system with ropes with mass.
- mod7.nb illustrates
     - Graphs pertaining to the very interesting problem of a bead oscillating on a rotating ring.
- mod8.nb models and animates
     - A bead sliding down a helical wire.
     - A pendulum with the fulcrum free to slide across a frictionless bar.
- mod9.nb models and animates

     - A string being plucked at 1/4 of the way along its length.
     - A string being hit by a square hammer.
- mod10.nb models and illustrates the temperature distribution of a metal bar with 
     - Initial temperature 0, both ends held at a temperature T.
     - Initial temperature across bar is a linear function.
     - Initial temperature 0, both end held at different temperatures.
- mod11.nb models and animates
     - The path of a marble rolling across a rotating disc surface, both from the rest frame and rotating disc frame.
